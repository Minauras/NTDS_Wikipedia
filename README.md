Everybody has at one point in their life found themselves in the akward situation of not knowing what to talk about. It often isn't easy to find common interests. 
We created a programm that can help find these common grounds to help a converstation along using Wikipedia.

We used the ntds_2018 environment (found here: https://github.com/mdeff/ntds_2018) and to run the code you also need the pygraphviz environment installed.
